# Bootstrapping a Blog Writing Habit

This is my first blog post, in what will be a blog writing habit[^1]. I need to bootstrap the blog writing habit with a first post, and writing a meta-blog post about why I'm doing this seems like a bit of a cheat, but it achieves two things: 1) clarifies for myself what I think I'm doing with these posts and 2) normalizes a low barrier to entry, both to allow me to get started instead of waiting for some deep insight and to establish that whatever I am thinking about or wrestling with, even if mundane, is worthy of writing about. The overall goal of the blog writing habit is to bootstrap myself, and this post serves to bootstrap that habit.

## Goals

My goals for this blog are self-improvement and leverage, and they are deeply interwined.

Having a goal at the outset is critical for knowing how to proceed, and to check if I'm going in the right direction, so it is important to articulate this. My goal may change over time, accepting that at the start is another way of lowering activation energy. Developing a blog writing habit, i.e. writing posts repeatedly and consistently, is a meta-goal to the goals for this blog, providing the iteration needed for deliberate practice and improvement[^2]. 

Foremost, I'm doing this to learn: to learn to write to learn, to work out what I think, to learn to think clearly and communicate that thinking with appropriate conciseness. I will learn more and remember longer by writing than merely thinking because writing forces reflection and deeper engagement with the material, and I want to shift from being only an information consumer to a producer[^3].

I intend to relearn to think with disciplined focus--this is a skill I once had, but I fear I've been robbed of this by the switch into management--and to be a great leader as well as a great manager this is required. I'm often so deep in the chowder during the week that I cannot step back, and having these posts will allow me to reflect at a slower pace, with greater remove and less reactivity.

To get better. It's very hard, to find the time to do it, and to get it doen efficiently and without large amounts of emotional energy expenditure. i'm so slow at it now, it takes a lot of time and emotional energyit takes a ton of time right now. current boss says if something is hard, do it more often. easy to get distracted, spend time tuning the process, worrying more about being impressive than curious, finding links.

Writing these thoughts out in blog posts to memorialize, for myself and others, so that I can refer to them easily without having to rewrite it in bits in pieces over slack, text, discord, email, google docs. I'll then be able to come back at a later time and ask, do I still think this way? What was I missing before or what have I learned since? Writing and distribution over the internet is a high leverage activity[^4].

I want to develop a voice and my own opinions that I'm comfortable believing and offering publicly. I believe that professional success is possible while being ethical, humane, helpful, and authentic to myself--while knowing that my authentic self may change. My tendenacy and desire would be to blend in with the team[^5]. I'm uncomfortable with personal success, but wish to becomme comfortable, as indeed this is necessary to prove to myself my own thesis about professional success. In order to be successful, and a successful leader, people must know what your opinion is, because the essense of leadership is making decisions. Success, for me at least, is a combination of external recognition and internal beliefs, which cannot be separated. External recognition requires the ability to promote yourself and report on your impact--which I dislike as much as almost every engineer I've managed--but through my maturation as a professional I've come to see the value in, and more importantly, the practical necessity. 

I want to write blog posts to both keep the demons at bay and to engage them head on, and to avoid an even worse fate, becomming a demon myself. These demons are the discomfort with visibility, the acceptance of professional success as something I want and have achieved, and to understand my own thinking and evolution in thinking (not a demon) in a way that keeps me honest, self-accountability for following through on something so visible and self-promotional, and to not get hung up on having the answers. To bring a spirit of curiosity without ego, and to allow for imperfection and iterative improvement, which is how I approach my own learning and work, but have difficultly applying when I write for consumption.

## Scope

I don't have a good answer here yet. I imagine that this blog will be scoped to the things I grapple with the most, which tend towards my professional identity as a software engineering manager. I don't expect this blog will be a diary[^6] or a substitute for a morning pages practice, though in the spirit of developing an authentic and fully human voice, I don't want to over-constrain the scope.

I went with "I don't want to be the worst dressed person at the wedding", and Orlando, to his credit, said "I can help with that".
