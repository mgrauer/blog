If you want to walk on your hands, it isn't that hard. Can you do a handstand? If not, start with doing a handstand against the wall for a while until you get comfortable, and gradually start to move out away from the wall (in your initial position before you go into your handstand), eventually you'll get to the point where you can do a handstand out in space. You can practice doing handstands against the wall in just a few min per day, which will help you get stronger. As you are starting to do your handstands, you are doing a few things: 1. getting comfortable getting up into a handstand 2. getting stronger in that position 3. learning how to come down safely with control when you lose your balance (the critical skill). There are generally a few ways to get up into a handstand: 1. kick up via falling (so fall down into your hand position about six inches from the wall and kick your legs up behind you until your heels hit the wall) 1a. you can do this with someone to spot you at first so your kicking is more controlled 2. start in a squat and put your hands down on the ground and then kick up from the squat--this seems to be harder for people but I like it better. Once you get comfy with whatever kickup method, start pulling your feet off the wall into a handstand, which at first should only be a few inches of movement. To do this more piecemeal you can do one foot at a time and leave one foot against the wall.
I learned from Capoiera (a martial art), and in that art they say to keep your spine straight, don't look at the ground (there's nothing to see there and you already know exactly where it is!) but look straight along the floor when you are in the handstand. A bent spine from looking at the ground will compromise your spine's structural integrity (in terms of keeping your body up). Engage your abs and actively push up and out from your shoulders and push up slightly from your hips (basically you don't want to be sagging anywhere).

in terms of taxes and RSUs, the short term vs long term gains only applies to changes in the value of the stock after you get the grant. so say you get a grant at $100, and the stock goes to $110 before you sell. You only pay capital gains on that $10. If you want to sell at the same price you were granted, there won't be any capital gains, so if you want to sell them all right away. This is my understanding from reading that schwab link you sent.

That handstand stuff is great. I tried it and so far my problem is that I seem to need to bend my legs a bunch like a scorpion's tail so that my feet hit the wall before my spine is straight up, then I just fall backwards again

I'll work on kicking up without bending my legs a bunch

That's great news about RSUs

Especially because of the MS RSUs I'll be getting at Github

oh right, i forgot about that part. as you do it more, you'll work on getting up and down with control, but at first it often feels more like flinging yourself up, and then you have so much momentum or different parts are hitting at the wrong time so you can't stay in the handstand. you could try having someone spot you, so you fling up, and they steady you so that you have time to balance in the handstand without falling away from the wall, and then they can walk away. they won't be having to support your full body weight, but more like putting you in the right place, by pushing on your hips or legs--be careful of kicking them with flinging legs. another trick is if you are banging off the wall (i don't quite understand what you mean about scorpion) is to move your hands a bit further out from the wall in your first placement, so you have more space for your body to flop over and your back to catch up with your legs, and you can still steady yourself (feet) against the wall so it isn't like you'll fall over. I'm talking like six inches to twelve inches from wall, not a huge gap.

MS RSUs, now those sound like they are worth something

Good call with the 2nd person. I'm gonna get my wife to help me

I wonder if my 11yo would be strong enough

they might be--the main thing they are doing is pushing your legs back against the wall, and you should be helping. so they'd only have to support half your body weight, and more pushing than lifting
